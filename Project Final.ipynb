This uncertainty leads to operational complexities, including unanticipated delays that can cause cascading effects such as extended wait times for surgeons and patients, underutilization of OR staff, and increased overtime costs. Improving scheduling accuracy and efficiency can help optimize resource utilization, minimize delays, and reduce operational expenses, thereby enhancing both patient care and hospital performance.\n"

The `'tardiness_con'` ensures that tardiness is controlled by balancing the waiting time, time gap, and operating room schedules, adjusted by the gap value `'d'`. The equations `'eq1'` and `'eq2'` maintain a balance between waiting and idling times for consecutive surgeries, with `'eq2'` extending the balance to include tardiness and earliness (`'gk[s]'`), ensuring that all times are synchronized and any delays or early completions are accounted for, ultimately optimizing the surgery scheduling process."

    "**Conclusion:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- The implementation of stochastic scheduling has proven to be a valuable tool in optimizing operating room (OR) efficiency and reducing costs.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- Our results highlight that the common practice of scheduling longer and more complex cases earlier in the day can negatively impact OR performance metrics, such as utilization and turnover time.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- By incorporating variability and uncertainty in the scheduling process, the stochastic model enables a more flexible and cost-effective approach, leading to a significant improvement in performance.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- The values of stochastic model (Model 1) and the deterministic model (Model 2) demonstrate a clear advantage.\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "- The Value of the Stochastic Solution (VSS) further emphasizes the cost savings and performance improvements achievable through stochastic scheduling, making it a highly effective strategy for optimizing OR resource management and minimizing operational costs."

    "1. **Alternative Heuristic Implementation and Testing**:  \n",
    "   - Extend the project by implementing **Heuristic 2 (H2)**, which sequences surgeries within each surgeon’s block based on increasing variance of surgery durations, and **Heuristic 3 (H3)**, which uses the coefficient of variation as the sorting criterion.  \n",
    "   - Test the performance of these heuristics against the current method in terms of schedule feasibility, waiting time, idling time, and operating room (OR) utilization.  \n",
    "   - Analyze scenarios with multiple ORs and compare the effectiveness of the heuristics in handling larger scheduling complexities.\n",

    "   - Conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of cost parameters, such as waiting time costs (`cw`), idling time costs (`cs`), and overtime costs (`c`), on scheduling outcomes.  \n",
    "   - This analysis could identify critical cost factors and provide insights for fine-tuning the scheduling model for different hospital priorities or budgetary constraints.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability to Multiple Operating Rooms and Surgeons**:  \n",
    "   - Explore how the heuristics perform in a multi-OR setting with multiple surgeons, considering interdependencies and shared resources.  \n",
    "   - Investigate how sequencing decisions in one OR influence the overall schedule and resource utilization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Incorporating Real-Time Adjustments**:  \n",
    "   - Develop a real-time scheduling framework that adjusts to unexpected delays or cancellations, integrating Heuristics 2 and 3 for dynamic sequencing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Comparative Analysis with Advanced Scheduling Algorithms**:  \n",
    "   - Benchmark Heuristics 2 and 3 against optimization-based approaches (e.g., mixed-integer programming) or machine learning-based methods for scheduling.  \n",
    "   - Study trade-offs between computation time and solution quality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These extensions could provide a deeper understanding of the scheduling problem, improve resource utilization, and adapt the model to practical, real-world hospital scenarios."
